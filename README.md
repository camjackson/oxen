[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/camjackson/oxen.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/camjackson/oxen)

A game engine written in rust.

Very early days, don't try to use this yet!

If you really want to see how it's used, take a look at [camjackson/omni](https://github.com/camjackson/omni),
which is a game / proof of concept using this engine.
